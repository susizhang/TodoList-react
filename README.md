1) Create a To do list where you can:

   -Add a Todo 
   -Mark a todo as done 
   -Edit a Todo 
   -Delete a Todo

2) Level 2

   -LocalStorage 
   -Object-oriented approach
    
    .Think of the architecture 
    .Code the classes with properties and methods accordingly

3) Level 3 (Optional)

   -Transform into React component for Todo / Todolist

   -Choose either arrow function programming / class Definitions _All of the methods / properties' should be set into components
